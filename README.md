Code from Test-Driven Development By Example, by Kent Beck


The code is in a simple maven project.
It is structured with a package per chapter (ch1, ch2).
As the code can be refactored within the chapter, then the method names may change so that the different versions of the code are available. This will be done with a convention of numbers after the method names (testMultiplication1, testMultiplication2) - so that the progression of the code can be tested.
The code was developed in an IDE - so it is probably best run from within one - so that you can run the specific test (e.g. testMultiplication1), to see the error that is expected from that particular piece of code.

Questions/Feedback welcome - set them as issues within GitHub.
